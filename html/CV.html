                Introduction
            </summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>As an experienced problem-solver in learning design and the software that supports it, my current role has given me lots of scope for creating learning materials and shaping the workflows that produce them. I have extensive experience in producing learning material for the diverse needs of the automotive industry, encompassing technical curricula as well as compliance and H&S. At various points this has involved authoring courses in Storyline, producing short films, creating illustrations and animation, and creating modules in HTML. My passion is designing learning materials that fully engage users, and I am seeking a role where I can have a transformative impact on the learning design process.</p>

                <h4>2022-	E-Learning Designer, Arrival</h4>
                <p>Responsible for bringing Arrival's training material to life with animation, video, and interactive graphics designed in HTML/CSS. Working at Arrival provided a unique opportunity to create learning material from scratch, without the use of an authoring tool, and develop an entire catalogue to support Arrival's automotive products and in-house needs from the ground-up.</p>
                <h4>2021-2022	Instructional Designer, Resource Group</h4>
                <p>Developing Resource Group's commercial aviation training offerings from lengthly compliance legislation to fully-realised interactive graphic experiences, designed to guide learners in accordance with sound e-learning principles.</p>
                <h4>2018-2021	Instructional Designer, Thatcham Research</h4>
                <p>Responsible for the design and construction of learning modules for Thatcham Research's Automotive Academy, for apprentices and specific vocational courses. Focussed on the design of media used within the modules initially, but the role expanded to a significant redesign of all subjects to meet new design guidelines and better fit established e-learning principles.</p>
                <h4>2010-2018	Technical Illustrator, Thatcham Research</h4>
                <p>Initially involved illustrating vehicle parts and assembling vehicle methods, but ultimately focussed on designing the InDesign templates themselves and guiding other team members in how to use them. In 2015 the company began a redesign of their repair methods product, and I was tasked with designing the layout of the new documents, provide input into streamlining workflows, and develop a method of transferring database output into a finished InDesign document via XML.</p>
